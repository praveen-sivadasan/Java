## A multi threaded application using Akka Framework

> Licensed under Apache 2.0 Akka is an open source framework used for creating distributed, concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable applications. Using the Actor Model we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build scalable, resilient and responsive applications. For fault-tolerance we adopt the "let it crash" model which the telecom industry has used with great success to build applications that self-heal and systems that never stop. Actors also provide the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.
